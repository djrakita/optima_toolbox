# optima_toolbox

The Optima Toolbox is an easy to set up and easy to use toolbox for applied planning and optimization, particularly designed for robot motion generation algorithms.  The core library is written in Rust, but the whole library can also be compiled to Python and Javascript (via webassembly).

### Development update on 6/29/22:
Optima is still under heavy development.  Currently, our robot collision proximity algorithm is implemented, and many more robot generation algorithms will be implemented by 8/1/22.  I will also be adding more documentation on setup steps, as well as how to use the library in Python and Javascript, in the coming weeks.
